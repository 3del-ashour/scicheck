# SciCheck — Science & Health Misinformation Detector

A multi-agent LLM system that fact-checks science and health claims using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## How It Works

1. User submits a science/health claim through the Streamlit UI.
2. **Claim Extractor** parses the input into atomic claims.
3. **Evidence Retriever** queries ChromaDB for relevant scientific sources.
4. **Source Credibility Analyzer** scores how reliable each source is.
5. **Verdict Synthesizer** outputs `Supported / Refuted / Insufficient Evidence` with citations.
6. **Safety Monitor** screens the final output for hallucinations and bias.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **LangGraph** + **LangChain** — agent orchestration
- **ChromaDB** — vector database
- **sentence-transformers** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) — embeddings (free, local)
- **OpenAI API** (`gpt-4o-mini`) — LLM backbone (cheap, fast)
- **Streamlit** — UI
- **Pydantic v2** — inter-agent contracts
- **pytest** — testing
- **ruff** + **black** — lint/format

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3del-ashour/scicheck.git
cd scicheck
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # fill in your OPENAI_API_KEY
python scripts/ingest.py   # build the vector DB
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

## Reading Order for New Members

1. This README
2. `ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `CONTRACTS.md` ← critical, defines how modules talk to each other
4. `ROLES.md` ← git workflow, branch rules, definition of done
5. Your own `docs/member-N-*.md`

## Deadlines

- **Final submission:** 06.05.2025 Wednesday 15:00
- **Internal milestones** in `ROLES.md`
